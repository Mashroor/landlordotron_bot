# Landlordotron Discord Bot

## Introduction and Purpose

This is a Discord bot I'm writing for my personal Discord server. The joke is that it's the landlord for my server, so it collects rent from tenants (other users), and kicks/bans them if they dont pay their rent after a month. Might add more functionality as I see fit, or if I get bored.

## Technology Used (So far)

* Discord API
* Python

## Command List

* **'!hello'** - Standard greeting, no purpose.
* **'!rent'** - Checks to see if tenant has paid rent for the month. Scolds if tenant has not paid.
* **'!payRent'** - Pays rent for user, stored for a month before reset.
* **' !domey'** - Links to https://moutonmerch.com/

## Plans for later

* Actually taking people money via Paypal
